<h1>About Project Octopus</h1>

<p>Octopus organizes provenance and use information about works found anywhere on the web, creating the first whole web observatory of cultural flows and dashboard for creators and fans.</p>

<p>The web is rich with latent provenance information, generated as a side effect of publishing on the web. But such publication lacks mechanisms to enrich, correct, search and crosslink provenance information. Even so, publication may be underutilized as a mechanism for asserting relationships between agents and works, relative to a dedicated provenance system with an explicit registration feature.</p>

<p>We are building the Octopus service, which enables its users and partners to structure and maintain latent provenance information, and to aggregate use information. Octopus can be thought of as a graph of provenance information, with at the most basic level, works and publication contexts as its nodes and relationships among works (e.g., adaptation and depiction) and between works and publication contexts (e.g., on a particular web page) as its edges. Each node and edge has properties which allow adding and refining information such as the creator and license of a work, type of adaptation (e.g., a cropped photo), and additional forms of use information (e.g., views in a particular publication context).</p>

<p>We think it will be fruitful to create a new provenance system, dedicated to tracking use of works and sourcing provenance information from across the web, creating the first whole web observatory of cultural flows and dashboard for creators and fans â€” Octopus. The first phase of Octopus is to build a centralized web site which includes interfaces for maintaining a basic set of provenance information concerning digital works and publication. You are now on that site.</p>
